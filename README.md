# Plants vs. Zombies 2 Level Editor

**Plants vs. Zombies 2 Level Editor**, also referred to as **Level Editor**, **PvZ2: LE** or simply **LE**, is a Windows GUI tool for generating PvZ2 levels.
It is written in C++ using SFML and it provides essential functionality for level creation.

## ⚠ Warning!
<a name="Warning"></a>

This branch is highly unfinished and unstable!
[The last commit](https://github.com/blazingzephyr/level-editor/commit/90f8a8ee28ecba57ce4af1565387487301a40831) is unfinished and probably does not even compile!

If you want to get the working tool, I highly recommend switching to [``2.0.x``](https://github.com/blazingzephyr/level-editor/tree/2.0.x) branch instead!

However, if you want to study the code I suggest branching off [this commit](https://github.com/blazingzephyr/level-editor/commit/4fd027b6f66dfce26a327a872c6011c263c1db0a).
